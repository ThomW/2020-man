# 2020-Man

I started working on this back in early January for a game jam. The theme was "2020" and I had this dumb idea for a Pac-Man game where instead of eating dots, the player was trying to get a PS5 or video card before catching COVID in a store. 

I've always loved Pac-Man. When I was a kid, I worked out moving enemies toward a player through a maze, but haven't done it in ages and haven't done it with smooth scrolling characters, so I wanted to try my hand at it again. So far, things are looking good -- player can move the player, ghosts roam the maze targeting the products as they appear, but the whole GAME of the game is missing.

I keep thinking about this project and kind of want to see it through, and adding it to Github lets me access it from more than one machine in the house. :D
